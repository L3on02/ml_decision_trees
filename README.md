# Implementing Decsiion Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Trees from scratch

In this project, I will implement the basic algorithms for Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Trees from scratch. Using nothing but numpy and pandas, I will implement these algorithms and test them on a dataset. Using the `sklearn` library, I will compare the results of my implementation with the results of the library's implementation to see how well my implementations will perform.
