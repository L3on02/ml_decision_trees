# Implementing Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Trees from scratch

In this project, I will implement the basic algorithms for Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Trees from scratch, using nothing but NumPy and pandas. Using the sklearn library, I will compare the results of my implementations with those of the library to evaluate their performance.

## How to use


## Structure of the project

The project is structured as follows:
.
├── README.md
├── examples
│   ├── decision_tree_example.py
│   ├── gradient_boosting_tree_example.py
│   └── random_forest_example.py
├── models
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── decision_tree.py
│   ├── gradient_boosting_tree.py
│   └── random_forest.py
└── requirements.txt

The models folder contains the implementation of the Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Tree algorithms. In the examples folder there are practical uses of the models. There also are comparables with the sklearn library.
