# Implementing Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Trees from scratch

In this project, I will implement the basic algorithms for Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Trees from scratch, using nothing but NumPy and pandas. Using the sklearn library, I will compare the results of my implementations with those of the library to evaluate their performance.
